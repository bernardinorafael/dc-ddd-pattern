# DDD - DDD - Tactical Modeling and Patterns

## Description

This project is being developed through the Full Cycle course classes, specifically the **DDD - Tactical Modeling and Patterns** module, which is being taught in TypeScript. However, for educational purposes, I am replicating the teachings in the Go programming language.
